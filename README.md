# Connect4Game
Java based GUI connect 4 game This project involves the creation of a connect 4 style game. It also describes various aspects that are involved in implementing this project, which includes the game board, game play, GUI, and code implementation. The game involves a vertical 7 X 6 board, with holes and all the pieces put into the board fall to the bottom. Each player would have 21 pieces, and alternate turns placing their colored pieces in the board until a player gets 4 pieces in a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal direction. The game ends in a draw if no one achieves that and all 42 pieces have been placed on the board. The code will involve a 2-D array of size 7x6, which will be filled and traversed by functions to place the pieces and then check if any of the win conditions is achieved. The project will at least require a game board class, a game piece class, a driver class, and a GUI class. Additional classes may be necessary for GUI to facilitate single player vs computer-controlled opponent. The state of the game will be saved to a text file after every turn by a player so players can return to the game if it is paused or interrupted. Robert and Emmanuel have assigned responsibility for coding various parts of the game. Overall, the abstract gives a clear overview of the intended projectâ€™s scope and implementation details. As earlier stated, further modifications and improvement could be made as deemed necessary or as time would permit.
